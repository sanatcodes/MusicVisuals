Name: Sanat Thukral

Student Number: D18129674

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
In this assigment have made 5 distinct visual art pieces which have been synced to music and compliment it creating a coherent and interactive experience for viewers. One of my aspirations for the assigment was to create variety in my visuals to showcase diversity and a unique perspective to shapes and abstract art. However, all visuals are cohesively connected through the music making it an interesting visual experience which is culminated through the power of code.

I'll explain my thoughtprocess and insipration for all of the visuals below wiht pictures for refference

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
